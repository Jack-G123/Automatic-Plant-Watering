# Automatic-Plant-Watering
This GitHub will contain all relevant files used during our development of our ECE 1000 Final Project/ Automatic Plant Watering System.

Project Summary
Watering a plany might seem like a simple task, but we were tasked to make it automated. By using a soil sensor we could know exactly when a plant may need water, with adjustable settings to fit for any type of plant, this project could lay the ground work for a great addition to a plant lovers home. Our end product was a functioning soil dryness reader with a motor that worked in conjunction with a relay to make sure the plant got the optimal amount of water at the right time. 

Project Capabilities
We have a small amount of capabilities now, but by setting up the foundation for a project like this, many different options can be added to it. The following details our capabilities for the build.
1. We have a soil sensor that will constantly tell the user the dryness of the soil when running
2. A motor to pump water into the chosen plant using the readings
3. Maybe more
